### Connected graph

- A connected graph is a graph that is connected in the sense of topological space.
- i.e. there is a path from any point to any other point in the graph.
- A graph that is not connected is said to be disconnected

### A complete graph

- It is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge

### Condition for a graph to be a spanning tree

- A subgraph of **G** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph **G**
- A connected subgraph **"S"** of $ graph(g,v) $ is said to be a Spanning tree of graph **G** if (if and only if)

> All the vertices of **"G"** must be present in **"S"**
> Number of edges should be **$ n-1 $**

### No of spanning tree in graph

- A complete graph has n^n-2 spanning trees where n is the number of vertices in the graph
